1. Transaction options are now passed to `.send()` part of the contract method call.
Contract args are passd to the JS method with the same name the contract has.


```js
await splitterContractInstance.Split(firstStranger, secondStranger).send({
             from    : samePerson ,
             value   : weiToSplit ,
             gasPrice: gasPriceWei
         }); 
```


2. `web3.eth.sendTransaction` is the only way to invoke the fallback function as of web3.js v1.0

3. gasPrice zero must be a string constant. Numbers are misinterpreted.

4. Contract method call produces transaction receipt only in web3.js v1.0. 
It has no`logs` array.

The name has been changed to "events". And now it is a dictionary.
