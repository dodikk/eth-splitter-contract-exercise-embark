1. Transaction options are now passed to `.send()` part of the contract method call.
Contract args are passd to the JS method with the same name the contract has.


```js
await splitterContractInstance.Split(firstStranger, secondStranger).send({
             from    : samePerson ,
             value   : weiToSplit ,
             gasPrice: gasPriceWei
         }); 
```


2. `web3.eth.sendTransaction` is the only way to invoke the fallback function as of web3.js v1.0

3. gasPrice zero must be a string constant. Numbers are misinterpreted.

4. Contract method call produces transaction receipt only in web3.js v1.0. 
It has no event logs array.
Still trying to figure this out. To be continue...
